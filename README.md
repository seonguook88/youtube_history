# Youtube History Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project lead me how to perform Data Analysis or is called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on my own personal youtube watch history. I'm using Google Takeout to obtain Youtube watch history data. This project took me about approximately 10 days to getting the final result. It's my first time to post a repository and hope you we can connect and discuss more about it. 

## Reason of the doing this project:
1. First step to obtain my own portfolio on Data Analysis.
2. Learn how to obtain personal data on application that we used everyday (in this example: Youtube, I won't discussed more about how to obtain the data here).
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and adding data visual to it.

## Objective to be obtain while doing this project:
- What is my youtube videos watch pattern? (Based on hour, day or week pattern)
- Top Youtube channel or videos or title of my Youtube Watch history

## Limitation:
- I only analyze the Youtube watch history of my own data from 2017 to 2023.
- There's some Korean language that can't be read on my data visualization process. (I don't know how it can be like that, if anyone knows how to handle, please let me know)


## Ethics on my data :
I know clearly that this is my personal data on watching youtube and as far as I know and concerned, there will be no particular issues. And lastly, this data are all for portfolio purpose and not for commercial or etc purposes.
